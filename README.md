## Subscription application and Contract status workflow

I. A customer create a subscription application with a status of PENDING
II. when all informations filled and the customer wants to apply it confirms it subscription application and asks for a review of it, the status moved from PENDING to REVIEWING
III. An insurer review the subscription application and can directly update the data if wanted, or finalize the subscription by applying a status:
   
   1. PAYMENT_PENDING: initiate the payment/checkout workflow by generating a checkout url
   
      - system register a contract with an INACTIVE status and vehicles linked to the contract from data present in subscription application 
      - customer click on the generated checkout url
      - contract status change from INACTIVE to ACTIVE upon successful subscription initialization

   2. REJECTED: customer can create a new susbcription application the current one won't be changed anymore
   3. TO_AMMEND: customer must update it's subscription application
   
      - customer can ammend its subscription application and restart from step II
